Destiny Armor usage:
Right now this thing is extremely basic
Step 1: Type in your original and final light levels desired
Step 2: Type in the two stat numbers (it does not matter what the actual stats are)
Step 3: Click the type of armor it is

The calculation is done when you click on the button, so if you have to do another
calculation, you have to click the button again.  Sorry.  It will be better over time.
I seriously just put this together in 2 hours while eating so please give me a break.

It gives you the unrounded final base stats, and the bonus stat number as well as the
overall total stats.  These are all estimates due to rounding errors and right now I am
leaving them unrounded.  Not sure if that is needed or not.
